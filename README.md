The home of the Python would become a cave upon Mount Parnassus, for nearby was sited the navel of the earth, the centre of the known world, and here was to be found an important prophetic stone. This place was of course called Delphi, the most important oracular site in the ancient world, and because of its link to Delphi, the Python was sometimes named Delphyne.
